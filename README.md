# Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing


## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

From knowing which products to buy, how many of them and when, to marketing the right products to the right customers at the right time, there are plenty of uses for data in retail - from the biggest multi-nationals to the smallest, single-outlet shop. By analysing customer purchase and product sales history, we can group products and customers into groups that behave similarly, and make data-driven business decisions that can improve a wide range of inventory and sales key performance indicators (KPIs). 

The specific data for this analysis comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and represents transactional data from a UK retailer from 2010-2011. This mostly represents sales to wholesalers so it is slightly different from consumer purchase patterns but is still a useful case study.

## Scope 

 1. Analyze the sales trends, market profitability, order cancellations and product categories through exporatory data analysis. 
 
 2. Leverage the product descriptions to better understand what product categories interest our customers the most.
 
 3. Implement K-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment customers in order to gain insight into shopping behaviors, analyze product affinity, measure marketing effectiveness, and better allocate future marketing spend.
